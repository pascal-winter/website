### Introduction AAAA

In the context of global aging population, improved longevity and low interest rates, the question of pension plan under-funding and adequate elderly financial planning is gaining awareness worldwide, both among experts and in popular media. Additional emergence of societal changes - Peer to Peer business model and Financial Disintermediation – might have contributed to the resurgence of “Tontine” in various papers and the proposal of further models such as Tontine Pensions (Jonathan Barry Forman & Sabin, 2018), Individual Tontine Accounts (Richard K. Fullmer, July 17, 2018), Pooled-survival fund (Newfield, May 2014), Pooled Annuity Funds (Donnelly, July 20, 2018) to name a few.

In this page, we explore an *allocation mechanism* that could allow the pooling of Individual Annuities through a self-insured community. This “Tontine” generalization retains the flexibility of an individual design: free contribution for a heterogeneous population, individualized asset allocation and predesigned annuitization plan. To ensure actuarial fairness, the model focuses on calculating a specific pool share to each member as a function of the prospective expected payouts and uses this share to allocate the deceased proceedings to survivors at regular intervals.
