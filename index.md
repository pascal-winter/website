## Individual Pooled Annuities
### A community based Retirement fund

In past few years, I toyed with the idea of generalizing the Tontines. From an actuarial prospective, it seems that a flexible Tontine funds can provide an interesting vehicle for retirement and/or investment.

I was pleased to discover that several academic studies already explored such ideas:
* *Richard K. Fullmer, M. J. (2018)*  [Individual Tontine Annuities](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3217551).  
* *Donnelly, C. (2015)* [Actuarial fairness and solidarity in pooled annuity funds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5120).

I took upon to further explore this kind of fund mechanism - especially on the allocation principles necessary to ensure "actuarial fairness" in a mechanism that allows:
* Non-homogeneous population (in terms of expected survival rate)
* Open entry mechanism: how to accommodate new entrants at each time steps ?
* Different Unit of accounts for each member
* Different horizon for each member

The detail of my study and proposed allocation can be found in the [**IPA section**]({{ "/ipa" | relative_url }}) of this site.


## Toolkit

A few years back, I have been introduced to Pandas, Numpy and other scientific packages for "non-IT experts". After a few hours toying with Jupiter - it immediately looked like it had the potential to revolutionize the daily actuarial practice:
* Data wrangling capabilities
* Replicability
* Robustness
* Depth of available libraries

In the [**Toolkit section**]({{ "/toolkit" | relative_url }}) of this website, I describe some of the tools I developed on my free time to test the potential and learn how to use these revolutionary tools.
