## Individual Pooled Annuities
### A community based Retirement fund

In past few years, I toyed with the idea of generalizing the Tontines. From an actuarial prospective, it seems that a flexible Tontine funds can provide an interesting vehicle for retirement and/or investment.

I was pleased to discover that several academic studies already explored such ideas:
* [Tontine Pensions](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol163/iss3/3/) *(Forman & Sabin, 2015)*
* [Individual Tontine Annuities](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3217551) *(Fullmer, 2018)*
* [Pooled-survival fund](https://www.actuaries.asn.au/Library/Events/FSF/2014/NewfieldPostRetirementPaper140505.pdf)*(Newfield, 2014)*
* [Actuarial fairness and solidarity in pooled annuity funds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5120) *(Donnelly, 2015)* to name a few.


I took upon to further explore this type of funds - especially on the allocation principles necessary to ensure "actuarial fairness" in a mechanism that would allow:
* Non-homogeneous population (in terms of expected survival rate)
* Open entry mechanism: how to accommodate new entrants at each time steps ?
* Different investment underlyings/allocation for each member
* Different horizon for each member
