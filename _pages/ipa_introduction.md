## Abstract  <a name="abstract"></a>

In the context of global aging population, improved longevity and low interest rates, the question of pension plan under-funding and adequate elderly financial planning is gaining awareness worldwide, both among experts and in popular media. Additional emergence of societal changes - Peer to Peer business model and Financial Disintermediation – might have contributed to the resurgence of “Tontine” in various papers and the proposal of further models such as  [Tontine Pensions](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol163/iss3/3/) *(Forman & Sabin, 2015)*,  [Individual Tontine Annuities](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3217551) *(Fullmer, 2018)*, [Pooled-survival fund](https://www.actuaries.asn.au/Library/Events/FSF/2014/NewfieldPostRetirementPaper140505.pdf) *(Newfield, 2014)*, [Actuarial fairness and solidarity in pooled annuity funds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5120) *(Donnelly, 2015)* to name a few.



In this page, we explore an **allocation mechanism** that could allow the pooling of Individual Annuities through a self-insured community. This “Tontine” generalization retains the flexibility of an individual design: free contribution for a heterogeneous population, individualized asset allocation and predesigned annuitization plan. To ensure actuarial fairness, the model focuses on calculating a specific pool share to each member as a function of the prospective expected payouts and uses this share to allocate the deceased proceedings to survivors at regular intervals.
