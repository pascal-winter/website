* **2016 ~ 2018:** China, *Chief Risk Officer*
* **2015 ~ 2016:** South Korea, *Chief Actuarial and Finance Officer*

This has allowed me to develop extensive knowledge in Insurance fields such as ALM, Risk Management, Investment, Product & Valuation, Management Accounting and Regulatory oversight to name a few.

Managerial roles also provided exposure to Strategic Planning and Transformation, with recurrent subjects of Digitalization, Automation and Data fluency.

With an appetite for science and technology, advances in **Data and Analytics** technics are a natural interest for Actuaries to optimize and enhance the daily practice - and also the whole insurance activity.
