# Modern Tontines: A Viable Alternative to Retirement Plans ?

## Abstract
In the context of global aging population, improved longevity and low interest rates, the question of pension plan under-funding and adequate elderly financial planning is gaining awareness worldwide, both among experts and in popular media. Additional emergence of societal changes - Peer to Peer business model and Financial Disintermediation – might have contributed to the resurgence of “Tontine” in various papers and the proposal of further models such as Tontine Pensions (Forman & Sabin, Survivor Funds, 2016), ITA - Individual Tontine Accounts (Fullmer & Sabin, 2018), Pooled-survival fund (Newfield, 2014), Pooled Annuity Funds (Donnelly, Actuarial fairness and solidarity in pooled annuity funds, 2015), Modern Tontines (Weinert & Grundl, 2016) to name a few.

In this paper, we revisit the mechanism proposed by (Fullmer & Sabin, 2018) - which allows the pooling of Modern Tontines through a self-insured community. This “Tontine” generalization retains the flexibility of an individual design: open contribution for a heterogeneous population, individualized asset allocation and predesigned annuitization plan. The actuarial fairness is achieved by allocating the deceased proceedings to survivors using a specific individual pool share which is a function of the prospective expected payouts for the period considered.

After a brief introduction, this article provides a formalization of the mathematical framework and analyses simulated outcomes based on various assumptions. In particular, the methodology bias is reviewed, and some adverse selection limits are exposed (the “term Dilemma). Some solutions are then proposed to overcome scheme shortcomings and we then discuss more generally the requirements for a practical implementation.
